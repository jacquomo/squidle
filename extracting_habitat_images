## Extracting Habitat Stills from BRUV videos

# This script extracts habitat stills from a bruv (and similar) videos and formats the folder structures, file names and metadata for upload into SQUIDLE+
#
# Authors: jacquomo.monk@utas.edu.au, justin.hulls@utas.edu.au
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Your working directory is the folder containing all BRUV video files (subfolders are fine) and metadata
# - Each video file has the OpCode within the file name (e.g.Beagle_1_1_1278_1279_1278_1.MP4, where 1_1 is the OpCode). 
#   and if each BRUV drop has multiple videos (e.g. gopros) associated with it, these are numbered video segments are numbered 1 to n at end of video name. 
#   If this is not the case you will need edit line 144. This section requires customisation for each campaign. Sorry.
# - A "\Metadata.csv" file structured according to GlobalArchive standards (see: https://marine-ecology.shinyapps.io/CheckEM/).
#   Additional attributes are required to capture if "left_cam_successful" and "right_cam_successful" cameras recorded successful as y/n. 
#   We will use the left camera, but if missing, we'll take the right

# - FFmpeg installed (https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).

## You have flexibility in naming and folder structures. See https://squidle.org/wiki/general_information/datasources_and_ingesting_from_cloud_repositories
## BUT once you have defined a folder structure, stick to it as SQUIDLE+ requires you platform structure and naming convenient to be consistent.
## If uploading using IMAS storage we suggest you stick to the folder structure defined below.


## If you do not have your own storage bucket for SQUIDLE+ to work from you can transfer images to IMAS using this transfer code:
## https://www.dropbox.com/request/E4RESrRWjxYtElLWMYKU
## Please note you are sharing the entire folder structure from Institution down (see below)
## All images in the IMAS bucket are FAIR and Open under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)

## 1. Setup Working Directory
folder_path <- choose.dir() # Navigate to the working folder. Should be the folder containing your correctly named video files. A copy of the metadata should be present in this folder also
setwd(folder_path)
getwd()

## 2. Define Metadata and Attributes
data.camera_model = "GoPro Hero10" #edit for your cameras
data.contact.primary ="jacquomo.monk@utas.edu.au" #add email for your primary contact person
data.contact.secondary = "neville.barrett@utas.edu.au" #add email for your secondary contact person	
data.funder = "NESP MAC"	#add funder names. If multiple delimit by semicolon
data.grant_no  = "4.21" #(optional) add relevant grant numbers. If multiple delimit by semicolon

institute = "IMAS" #set this for your institute. should remain the same between uploads
platform = "IMAS_stereoBRUV" #set this for each platform format should remain the same between uploads 
campaign = "202408_Beagle_AMP" #set this for each campaign. format should remain the same between uploads
licence = "Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)" #Set as appropriate 
jpgname = "stereoBRUV" #dont change this unless you are working with a different platform
full_res = "full_res"#dont change this
thumbnails = "thumbnails" #dont change this


### Set up folder structure
#### Define the base directory (you can adjust this as needed)
base_dir <- file.path(institute, platform, campaign)

#### Define the folders to create
folders <- c("full_res", "thumbnails")

#### Create the folder structure
for (folder in folders) {
  dir_path <- file.path(base_dir, folder)
  if (!dir.exists(dir_path)) {
    dir.create(dir_path, recursive = TRUE)
    message("Created folder: ", dir_path)
  } else {
    message("Folder already exists: ", dir_path)
  }
}


## 2.0 Read in metadata and sort out attribute names
meta<-read.csv(list.files(pattern = "*.csv"))%>% #This assumes you only have one csv in working directory representing metadata
  mutate(site = opcode,
         timestamp_start = parse_datetime(date_time) %>%  #convert local time date to UTC
           with_tz("UTC") %>% 
           format("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"),  # Format to ISO 8601
         pose.lat = latitude_dd,
         pose.lon	= longitude_dd,
         pose.dep = depth_m,
         pose.data.inclusion_probability = inclusion_probability,
         data.spatially_balanced	=  ifelse(!is.na(inclusion_probability), "y", "n"), #assign a yes/no based on if there is a inclusion probability
         data.licence = licence,
         data.camera_model = data.camera_model,
         data.contact.primary =  data.contact.primary,

         data.funder = data.funder,
         data.grant_no = data.grant_no #optional. remove if not used
  )%>%
  mutate(timestamp_start = parse_datetime(date_time))%>%
  dplyr::select("site","timestamp_start":"data.grant_no","left_cam_number":"right_cam_successful")%>%
  filter(!( left_cam_successful == 'n' &  right_cam_successful == 'n')) %>%  # Filter out rows where either cam is unsuccessful
  mutate(habitat.image = paste(site, ifelse(left_cam_successful == 'y', left_cam_number, 
                                            ifelse(right_cam_successful == 'y', right_cam_number, NA)), sep="_")) %>%  # Join site with right cam if left is unsuccessful, or NA if both are unsuccessful
  glimpse()


## 3. Perform Data Quality Checks
## Check for missing values
missing_values <- meta %>% summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.)))) %>% pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "Column", values_to = "Missing_Count")
print("Missing values per column:")
print(missing_values) # should be zero

## Check for duplicates
duplicates <- meta %>%
  filter(duplicated(.))

if (nrow(duplicates) > 0) {
  print("Duplicate rows found:")
  print(duplicates)
} else {
  print("No duplicate rows found.")
}

### Check for any empty or negative depth values
if ("pose.dep" %in% colnames(meta)) {
  depth_issues <- meta %>%
    filter(is.na(pose.dep) | pose.dep < 0)
  
  if (nrow(depth_issues) > 0) {
    print("Rows with empty or negative depth values in 'Depth':")
    print(depth_issues)
  } else {
    print("No empty or negative depth values in 'Depth'.")
  }
} else {
  print("Column 'Depth' not found in metadata.")
}

## Plot metadata on map to make sure it looks ok
## Create a Leaflet map
leaflet(meta) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng = ~pose.lon, lat = ~pose.lat, label = ~site)


## 4. Extract Frame Rates from MPG4 or AVI Video Files including in Subfolders
video_dir <- file.path(getwd()) # can change this if you are working from different folders

## Function for keeping only even camera number (right cams) and first video for each drop
video_files <- list.files(
  video_dir, 
  pattern = "_[0-9]+_2\\.MP4$", #keeps just the second video named with an "_2" at end. If your naming conversion differs to this you will need to edit this line
  full.names = TRUE, 
  ignore.case = TRUE, 
  recursive = TRUE #in case you have subfolders
)


## 5. Join metadata with list of files. You will need to customise this section depending on your video file naming convension.
combined <- as.data.frame(video_files) %>%
  mutate(
    Filename = str_extract(video_files, "[^/]+$"),  # Extracts the filename
    site = str_extract(Filename, "Capt_\\d+|Beagle_\\d+(?:_\\d+)?"),  # You will likely need to edit this line of code. Extracts "Capt_5", "B1", or "B165_1"
    site = ifelse(str_detect(site, "^Capt_"), site, str_replace(site, "^Beagle_", "B")),  # Same here. You will need to edit this line of code. At present it keeps "B" at the start
    site = str_replace(site, "(B\\d+)_\\d{4}$", "\\1"),  # Same here. You will need to edit this line of code. Removes the 4-digit number after the first underscore
    habitat.image = paste(site, str_extract(Filename, "(\\d{4})(?=_2\\.MP4$)"),sep="_")  # Same here. You will need to edit this line of code.Extracts the four-digit number before "_2.MP4" and merges with site
  ) %>%
  select(!site)%>%
  right_join(meta, by = "habitat.image") %>%  # Left join to ensure all Video parts rows are kept
  mutate(clip_start_in_seconds = 2)%>% # take a image @ 2seconds into bottom time of the second video 
  mutate(image.name = paste(campaign,platform,habitat.image, sep= "_"))%>%
  # filter(image.name %in% c("202408_Beagle_AMP_IMAS_stereoBRUV_B8_6_1280","202408_Beagle_AMP_IMAS_stereoBRUV_B12_2_1280","202408_Beagle_AMP_IMAS_stereoBRUV_B19_3_1258","202408_Beagle_AMP_IMAS_stereoBRUV_B31_5_1280"))%>% #Use this to subset if you need to redo some of the images
  glimpse()       


## Check for missing values
missing_values <- combined %>% summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.)))) %>% pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "Column", values_to = "Missing_Count")
print("Missing values per column:")
print(missing_values) # should be zero

## Check that we have the same number of rows in metadata as combined df
dim(meta)
dim(combined)

## 6. Iterate over each row of 'combined' to process extract habitat stills
#Ensure the output directory exists
full_res_folder <- paste(getwd(),base_dir,"full_res", sep= "/")
full_res_folder

if (!dir.exists(full_res_folder)) {
  dir.create(full_res_folder, recursive = TRUE)
}


# Run extraction
for (i in 1:nrow(combined)) {
  
  # Get the full video file path
  video_full_path <- combined$video_files[i]
  
  # Check if the file exists
  if (!file.exists(video_full_path)) {
    cat("File not found:", video_full_path, "\n")
    next
  }
  
  # Get the timestamp in seconds for the still image
  still_time <- combined$clip_start_in_seconds[i]
  
  # Use image.name as the output file name
  output_image_name <- paste0(combined$image.name[i], ".jpg")
  output_image_path <- file.path(full_res_folder, output_image_name)
  
  # FFmpeg command to extract a still image
  ffmpeg_command <- paste(
    "ffmpeg -ss", still_time,
    "-i", shQuote(normalizePath(video_full_path, winslash = "/")),
    "-frames:v 1 -q:v 1",
    shQuote(normalizePath(output_image_path, winslash = "/"))
  )
  
  # Execute the FFmpeg command and capture the output
  cat("Running: ", ffmpeg_command, "\n")
  ffmpeg_output <- system(ffmpeg_command, intern = TRUE)
  
  # Print the ffmpeg output for debugging
  cat(ffmpeg_output, sep = "\n")
  
  # Check if the output file was created and has a valid size
  if (file.exists(output_image_path) && file.info(output_image_path)$size > 1024) {
    cat("Successfully created:", output_image_path, "\n")
  } else {
    cat("Failed to create a valid output file:", output_image_path, "\n")
  }
}

##IMPORTANT. Make sure you manually check the output folder to ensure that you images are ok and there are no out of water shots, etc

## 7. Now lets do some checks and move files into folders for SQUIDLE+ 
#### Note that this naming pattern needs to be standard for your dataset between campaigns.
### Now lets join renamed jpg images to metadata for SQ+
final.metadata <- list.files(path = full_res_folder, pattern = "\\.jpg$", ignore.case = TRUE, full.names = TRUE, recursive = FALSE) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rename(image.path = ".") %>%
  mutate(
    Filename = str_extract(image.path, "[^/]+$"),  # Extracts the filename
    site = str_extract(Filename, "Capt_\\d+|B\\d+(?:_\\d+)?"),  # Extracts Capt_### or B_### or B_###_### # You will likely need to edit this line of code. Extracts site from image name eg. "Capt_5", "B1", or "B165_1"
    site = str_replace(site, "_\\d{4}$", ""),  # Removes trailing _#### if present #  You will likely need to edit this line of code. 
    Filename = str_remove(Filename, "\\.jpg$"),
    key = Filename
    ) %>%
  left_join(combined, by = 'site') %>%
  dplyr::select("key","site","timestamp_start","pose.lat","pose.lon","pose.dep":"data.grant_no")%>% #note you may need to change selection if you dont have a grant number
  glimpse()



# ### Write out final metadata for later
# write.csv(final.metadata, file.path(file.path(getwd(), base_dir), "202106_Huon_AMP_BRUV_Metadata_formatted_final.csv"), row.names = FALSE, na = "") ##change name as needed leaving Metadata_formatted. Optional save if you need it

## 8.0 Now create thumbnails
### Set thumbnail folder
thumbnails_folder <- file.path(getwd(),base_dir, "thumbnails")
thumbnails_folder

### Loop through the jpg files, resize, and save as thumbnails
for (jpg_file in jpg_files) {
  ## Read the image
  img <- image_read(jpg_file)
  
  ## Calculate the thumbnail dimensions to ensure a maximum height of 350px
  original_width <- image_info(img)$width
  original_height <- image_info(img)$height
  
  thumbnail_height <- min(350, original_height)  # Ensure thumbnail_height is a maximum of 350px
  thumbnail_width <- (thumbnail_height / original_height) * original_width  # Maintain the original aspect ratio
  
 ## Resize the image
  img_thumbnail <- image_scale(img, geometry = paste0(round(thumbnail_width), "x", round(thumbnail_height)))
 
  ## Extract the file name without extension
  file_name <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(jpg_file))
  
  ## Save the thumbnail in the output folder
  thumbnail_output_path <- file.path(thumbnails_folder, paste0(file_name, ".jpg"))
  image_write(img_thumbnail, path = thumbnail_output_path, format = "jpeg")
}


## 9.0 Now let's make deployment folder for each deployment, move these images into these folders and split metadata
### Quick checks before moving files to deployment folders
#### 9.1 Check site names metadata
unique_sites <- unique(final.metadata$site)
print(unique_sites)

### 9.2 Check number of files in full res and thumbnail folders - should have same number of files in each
#### Get list of jpg files in each folder
full_res_files <- list.files(full_res_folder, pattern = "\\.jpg$", full.names = FALSE)
thumbnails_files <- list.files(thumbnails_folder, pattern = "\\.jpg$", full.names = FALSE)

#### Count number of files in each folder and get file names
file_counts <- tibble(
  folder = c("Full Resolution", "Thumbnails"),
  file_count = c(length(full_res_files), length(thumbnails_files))
)

#### Get file names for comparison
file_names <- tibble(
  full_res_files = full_res_files,
  thumbnails_files = thumbnails_files
)

##### Check if they have the same number of files
if(length(full_res_files) == length(thumbnails_files)) {
  message("Both folders have the same number of jpg files.")
} else {
  message("The number of jpg files in each folder is different.")
}

##### Check if file names match
if(setequal(full_res_files, thumbnails_files)) {
  message("File names match between the folders.")
} else {
  message("File names do not match between the folders.")
} 


### 9.3 Now move images from full_res to subfolders in deployment folders
#### Extract site from 'key' column in 'metadata'
unique_imgs <- final.metadata %>%
  dplyr::select(site, key) %>%
  glimpse()

#### Move all full_res and thumbnail jpgs from full_res and thumbnails folders to full_res and thumbnails subfolders in each deployment 
path_to_folder <- file.path(getwd(), base_dir)

for (i in 1:nrow(unique_imgs)) {
  site <- unique_imgs$site[i]
  key <- unique_imgs$key[i]
  
  site_folder <- file.path(path_to_folder, site)
  full_res_subfolder <- file.path(site_folder, "full_res")
  thumbnails_subfolder <- file.path(site_folder, "thumbnails")
  
  ## Create site, full_res, and thumbnails folders if they don't exist
  if (!dir.exists(site_folder)) {
    dir.create(site_folder, recursive = TRUE)
  }
  if (!dir.exists(full_res_subfolder)) {
    dir.create(full_res_subfolder, recursive = TRUE)
  }
  if (!dir.exists(thumbnails_subfolder)) {
    dir.create(thumbnails_subfolder, recursive = TRUE)
  }
  
  ## Move only the matching full_res JPG file
  full_res_file <- file.path(full_res_folder, paste0(key, ".jpg"))
  if (file.exists(full_res_file) && !file.exists(file.path(full_res_subfolder, basename(full_res_file)))) {
    file.rename(full_res_file, file.path(full_res_subfolder, basename(full_res_file)))
  }
  
  ## Move only the matching thumbnail JPG file
  thumbnail_file <- file.path(thumbnails_folder, paste0(key, ".jpg"))
  if (file.exists(thumbnail_file) && !file.exists(file.path(thumbnails_subfolder, basename(thumbnail_file)))) {
    file.rename(thumbnail_file, file.path(thumbnails_subfolder, basename(thumbnail_file)))
  }
}

# final.metadata$key <-str_replace(final.metadata$key, "B(\\d+)_", "B_\\1_")
# final.metadata$site  <-str_replace(final.metadata$site, "\\bB(\\d+)", "B_\\1")



#### 9.4 Now let's split metadata csv into each deployment folder
for (site in unique_sites) {
  ## Subset final metadata for the current site
  site_metadata <- final.metadata[final.metadata$site == site, ]
  
  ## Remove the site column
  site_metadata <- site_metadata[, !names(site_metadata) %in% "site"]
  
  ## Define the file name and path
  file_name <- paste0(campaign, "_", platform, "_", site, "_Metadata.csv")
  file_path <- file.path(path_to_folder, site, file_name)
  
  # ## Create the directory if it doesn't exist
  # dir.create(dirname(file_path), recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)
  
  ## Write the subsetted metadata to a CSV file
  write.csv(site_metadata, file_path, row.names = FALSE)
}

### 10 Run some checks to makes sure each deployment folder has correct number of files 
#### Function to count files by type in a directory
count_files_by_type <- function(dir) {
  files <- list.files(dir, full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
  file_types <- tools::file_ext(files)
  file_types <- ifelse(file_types == "", "No Extension", file_types)
  file_type_counts <- table(file_types)
  data.frame(File_Type = names(file_type_counts), Count = as.numeric(file_type_counts))
}

#### Get a list of all directories in the specified folder
dirs <- list.dirs(path_to_folder, full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)

#### Loop through each directory and count the number of files by type
files_count_by_type <- lapply(dirs, count_files_by_type)

#### Create a data frame with the folder names and file counts by type
summary_df <- data.frame(
  Folder = rep(dirs, sapply(files_count_by_type, nrow)),
  do.call(rbind, files_count_by_type))%>%
  view()

### 11 Do some cleaning to delete old files folders
#### Define the pattern for the CSV file to delete
csv_pattern <- "final.csv$"  # This ensures it ends with 'final.csv'

#### Get a list of CSV files that match the pattern in the output folder
csv_files <- list.files(path_to_folder, pattern = csv_pattern, full.names = TRUE)

#### Delete the matched CSV file(s)
for (csv_file in csv_files) {
  if (file.exists(csv_file)) {
    file.remove(csv_file)
    cat("Deleted CSV file:", csv_file, "\n")
  } else {
    cat("CSV file does not exist:", csv_file, "\n")
  }
}

#### Delete the full_res and thumbnails folders
folders_to_delete <- c("full_res", "thumbnails")
for (folder in folders_to_delete) {
  folder_path <- file.path(path_to_folder, folder)
  if (dir.exists(folder_path)) {
    unlink(folder_path, recursive = TRUE, force = TRUE)
    cat("Deleted folder:", folder_path, "\n")
  } else {
    cat("Folder does not exist:", folder_path, "\n")
  }
}
